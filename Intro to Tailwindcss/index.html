     scale on large team. it easy to customize,
     adapts to any design and buld size is tiny.</h1>
     <h3 class="text-red-500">Tailwind is so low level it never encourages 
        you to design the same site twice.Even with the 
        same color palette and sizing scale.its easy to
         build the same component with a completely
          different look in the next project. </h3>
